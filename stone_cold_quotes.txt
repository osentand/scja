You can talk about your Psalms and your John 3:16. Well, Austin 3:16 says I just whooped your *ss.
And that's the bottom line, cuz Stone Cold said so!
Sportsmanship...what a load of crap, don't preach your morality to me. Steve Austin doesn't have any mercy... you want mercy? Take your *ss to church!
Why have you not broken from the pack? You're playing it safe. Safe aint gonna get you sh!t in this world
You treat me like a dog and you expect me to smile? You remind me of a jackass.
I'm telling you this - if Stone Cold comes back out, somebody's going to get their ass whipped!
I no longer need my power tie, because I always have, my power finger.
Austin 3:16 says I just whipped your @$$!
You see, everyone in that locker-room gotta pager. And everyone that looks at that pager, sees the three-one-six, so their ass belongs to me.
And I also appreciate the fact that, hell, you can kiss my ass!
...if you are fat, no matter what you wear, nothing is going to make you sexier.
I'll open up a can of whoop-ass on you!
Nobody, especially Vince McMahon, tells Stone Cold Steve Austin what to do, and that's the bottom line!
If you put a s infront of hitman, you have my exact thoughts on Bret Hart
You want mercy? Take your ass to church!
Tune in next week, same Stone Cold time, same Stone Cold Channel!
Does anybody have, a cold beer for Steve Austin?!??!!?
Sorry, my watch doesn't speak spanish.
Vince Mcmahon may have bought this ring but if you get your *ss in it Stone Colds going to throw your *ss out of it
I eat so much chicken, I'm surprised I haven't grown feathers yet.
Last time I had three or four of those I crapped for three days straight!
Save your money, pay your taxes, it doesn't last forever...
McMahon 3:16 says 'I just pissed my pants!'
I love the business of pro wrestling and it is something I know better than anything else I know about.
I can drive anything on wheels... I can drive anything, actually.
Unless you got real short and real fat, you ain't no Booker T!
That was the absolute worst catch phrase I've ever heard in the history of Monday Night Raw.
Become a champion like Stone Cold Steve Austin!To all my little Hulkamaniacs, say your prayers, take your vitamins and you will never go wrong.
Whatcha gonna do, when Hulkamania runs wild on you!
I woke up and realized life is great and people are awesome and life is worth living.
I've been knocked out a few times , but I have no idea how many concussions I've ever had.
Train. Say your prayers. Eat your vitamins.
Then as I was wrestling as Terry Boulder. I was on a talk show with Lou Ferrigno, and I was actually bigger than he was! I went back to the dressing room that night and all of the wrestlers go 'Oh my God you're bigger than the hulk on TV' so they started calling me Terry 'The Hulk' Boulder.
It's tough because a lot of my friends in normal life, a lot of my friends in the entertainment business, and a lot of my friends in the wrestling business are gay. Just to say something spiteful and hurtful, I don't get it... if it was true and I was gay, I'd embrace it, and I'd tell you guys about it and I'd celebrate it.
I fear no man, no beast or evil, brother.
I'm the man that made wrestling famous.
Negativity and Hulkamania - 2 things that don't go together.
I hate to toot my own horn but I just feel that I know people and I know fans and I don't feel there is that Angelina Jolie/Brad Pitt barrier with me. I've always felt from everyone I talk to that the fans feel like I'm tangible and they can talk to me and they know me.
I've been around so long and no matter if I've done good things or bad things, or my personal life has been good or bad, the fans have always stuck with me.
Right before Pamela Anderson met Tommy Lee I got this crazy script to do this incredible movie with her where I play this cop with a young partner like Brad Pitt who is in love with Pamela Anderson and he gets killed in the line of duty and she falls in love with me and it gets really crazy. I turned that down.
I've hung & I've bung...
In the ring, it's fun to be the bad guy, but 24 hours a day, when you have to talk to kids, and you see Make-A-Wish kids that love you, the bad guy stuff is not fun. I'd rather be a good guy 24 hours a day than a bad guy just for a few minutes in the ring.
The only time I'm not Hulk Hogan is when I'm behind closed doors because as soon as I walk out the front door, and somebody says hello to me, I can't just say 'hello' like Terry. When they see me, they see the blond hair, the mustache, and the bald head, they instantly think Hulk Hogan.
It's amazing that even though I've lost everything else, I still have wrestling.
Everybody's out there wrestling like a robot.
I used to be a session musician before I was a wrestler. I played bass guitar. I was big pals with Lars Ulrich and he asked me if I wanted to play bass with Metallica in their early days but it didn't work out.
People always expect Hulk Hogan to be standing up straight, or to have the bandanna on, or to not have my arms covered up. If I have an extra large shirt on people go 'oh yeah you look small.' It kind of ruins the mystique.
I've always felt from everyone I talk to that the fans feel like I'm tangible and they can talk to me and they know me.
Whatcha gunna do when Hulkamanina and my 24 pythons run wild on you?!?!?!!?
The fans know what's happened to me over the past couple of years. I lost my family. I pretty much got devastated financially and the fans know that I've had some hard times - and that's the nature of loyal fans. They want to see the people that they love and believe in get back on their feet.
I'm real good with math, with numbers, like my dad was. I'm pretty much dialed in.
We're probably the opposite of the Osbournes. We run a very tight ship.
I'm real critical of myself and if I take the bandana off my head I'm completely bald headed and go from being 58 to looking 68 instantly.
I train all the time and the weird thing is I'm in the gym with people between 20 and 25 years old and I look in the mirror and I look better than they do and they are young kids - either they haven't trained hard enough or they aren't serious enough.
Well, you know somethin', Mean Gene...
When you start out in the wrestling business, you make a lot of mistakes, tripping over your own feet and looking like a fool.
When you're nWo, you're nWo for life.
The best wrestlers, whether its a Hulk Hogan or a Rey Mysterio, are the ones who have psychology and can understand this business.
We're the greatest athletes in the world without a doubt.
After watching wrestling for 20 years, I thought I had enough confidence to do it. There were no wrestling schools at the time.
A lot of people didn't realize that with the carpet being pulled out from under me in such a short time frame I got to such a bad place.
If anybody dared say wrestling was fake, you'd punch 'em. And you never used the word show. If you used the word show it was an insult.
Hopefully I can become the Babe Ruth of the World Wrestling Federation and be the champion at the same time.
I know what happens every time I get in front of a UK crowd - they just go nuts and they are so nice and excited and crazy and they won't sit down.
I love to give the fans what they want. They're what I miss most when I'm not wrestling. That time in the ring is like being in heaven for me.
If I have a problem with someone I talk about them. I don't pick on their kids.
If I do hit that rope and do a hop, skip and a jump and get up as high as I can, I'm just going to hold my breath, because I know i'm going to hear all kinds of scar tissue popping.
I'm 58 years old and I just went through 8 back surgeries. They started cutting on me in February 2009, and I was basically bed ridden for almost two years. I got a real dose of reality that if you don't have your health, you don't have anything.
I promised each and every Hulkamaniac when I went to that great battlefield in the sky I would bring the WWF title with me.
The coolest thing, and I have it at home, is a huge Hulk Hogan, normal-sized pinball machine. When people come over they play it for hours. When you hit the bumpers and the bells ring it goes, 'Oh yeah!' The whole time you're playing this machine it's yelling and screaming at you, 'What you gonna do, brother?!' I think that's the coolest.
As far as my divorce goes, I love my family and I love my wife to death and I just don't know what tomorrow's going to bring.
People are really nice in the world. The majority of every single person I meet is really nice. Some people get excited, and some people freak out when they accidentally run into me, but across the board most people are really nice, so I just like to treat people how they treat me.
I totally understand O.J., I get it.
I feel really good right now. It will really be a tough decision. It's so hard to give up what you love doing. Hanging up the boots will not be an easy thing to do.
Wrestling needs to be about the art form again. It needs to be about painting a picture and having a really good match.
Be a father first. Don't put a priority of being a friend with your wife first, or a friend with your kids first.
When you're with the nWo, when you're with Hollywood, you're just...too...sweet!
When the script for 'The Wrestler' kept coming to me I said, This movie is so good if you put me in the film as a wrestler people are going to say, 'No credibility, Hulk Hogan isn't a good actor,' whatever Hollywood thinks of me.
There's a lot of gimmick infringement out there, but that's cool. It's a compliment. But it all started right when I first came into the Garden. I came down to 'Eye of the Tiger' and when I hit the ring with the Sheik, I just put my hand up to my ear by accident, and the crowd got louder. I was like 'Oh, that works.'
You can have a wrestling idea, but you need to have these momentum-shifting moves. We had the Hulkamania movement, then it shifted to the beer-drinking, Stone Cold era, we reinvented the business with growing the black beard and becoming the bad guy, what's that next level.
I'd like to be the John Wayne of the '90s. Not in terms of being the macho guy, but as a solid male leading character. Making an action-adventure comedy that kids can see with their families is a natural extension of what I did in wrestling.
As far as the path of [Bill] Goldberg and all his ultimate success, I don't think any of that was planned. It was all organic. All of it was so different.
To think that Donald Trump could have his finger over the big red button is absolutely terrifying.
I shaved a lot off of a lot that I saw in that I like to be less is more and make everything count and not give anyone anything extra. I was what you see is what you got. It was organic. I came up with the persona. The persona is me, coupled together with a lot of my interests.
I think Donald Trump would be a horrible President.
I think if Donald Trump won, I would move to Canada.
Sometimes my natural instincts take over and I just go overboard.
I spar with 18-year-old kids that try to kick my ass all the time. As far as going in and doing a wrestling match, I think that pales in comparison, but it's a totally different thing. It's completely different. You have to condition your body.
At the end of the day, when you are in the front office, your tenure is dictated by the people surrounding you.
I've known Mark Hunt for a long time, and I've known Brock [Lesnar] for a while. I think that it's a very interesting match-up. I think it's good on the UFC for making that match-up.
Luckily I stayed in shape due to wrestling.
I think it's widely known at this stage that I am willing to put past differences aside and make some money and do the right thing for the fans. If it happens, it happens. It's all good. If it doesn't, I truly am not going to miss a beat of my life.
I am a competitor and always have that itch until the day I die, but I won't let the itch supersede being a businessman.
Whether I was a character in WCW, WWE or The Longest Yard, you want to be able to - the best part about myself is that I have a very wide range of emotions in that one second I can be speaking on Capital Hill about dog fighting and giving them a voice, which they can't obviously speak for themselves.
Free agency screws everybody's allegiances up. Whether it be football, baseball, hockey, basketball, whatever it may be. It's really hard.
I had never imagined myself doing [wrestling]. Once I came to the realization that it was a possibility, I just tried to concentrate on what I thought people would enjoy.
At the end of the day you go out and do your job and follow your directions.
The fact is that I made a stand a number of times in my career, and I did it because I knew I was right.
What kind of moron would go to work for half the amount of money, when they could sit at home and collect what's written in a contract?
The cutthroat part of it is that professional wrestling has no union. There are a number of people that are taken advantage of on a daily basis.
I was a football player and competitor in life.
At this time, the only thing that would get me back in the ring is something that would positively impact those in need. If selling out another major event would allow me to bring a ship full of supplies to hand out to those in need, I'd say that would be very significant.
I am always a competitor and my wife and son have never seen me wrestle.
I'm also a devoted father, and you see that side of me at the same time.
Pardon me, not to sound elitist, but I wanted to put something together that I would enjoy. I thought at that time, what satiated me, what interested me, what intrigued me, I thought other people would like also. And you blend that with some forward thinking of predicting the UFC and MMA were going to be ultimately as big as it became.
The relationship with WWE obviously has gotten better because after my name has been shoved down their throats from 2K [Games] for the past years, they finally passed off on it. They finally okayed it.
WWE has not called me to be a part of any roster. My relationship with WWE stands with the video game and the video game only. If they want to extend an olive branch and pick up the phone, then I will make a comment on that once they do it. But prior to that, nothing's been done.
Like most of the movies I have participated in before, it's not a far departure from my actual self. TJ is a Special Forces, hand-to-hand combat expert. He's got a big heart. He has a sense of duty that never ends, whether he is active duty or as you find him in Check Point, retired.
Georgia Dome was a pretty big eye opener that I had something kind of going in the right direction. It seemed like a movement, and I was greatly appreciative for the chants and the signs.
At the end of the day, when two combatants get into the ring and/or cage, it's anybody's game, especially in MMA.
I believe that it was a testament to the change of power from the company to the fans because the more the fans ate it up, the more the company gave them what they want.
You get hit by one of those right hands or an uppercut or a left hook by Mark Hunt, then you know that **** is on and that cage is locked, and there's nowhere to go.
I am busy right now with my family, let alone all my other projects. It's an opportunity if it presents itself.
My foray into the wrestling world is well documented in that I have stated many a time that I am not the kid that grows up and aspires to put wrestling trunks and wrestling boots on and get in the ring and flies around to entertain people.
My character was a homogenization of various things, whether it be the attitude of a Bruiser Brody, or the look of Nikita Koloff or the way that Nikita looked at the people. I took a little bit of what I liked and what I had seen throughout the years from everybody that I was entertained by and made it my own.
Aside from doing publicity for this film [The Longest Yard], I have Auto Maniac coming on the History Channel and since I got married recently, we are going to get to that Honeymoon we had to put off.
Adam [Sandler] is a good basketball player, so he is a natural athlete, he worked with Sean Salisbury to make his footwork and delivery smooth, and he did a great job.
I do not get involved in the game to think that it is a future transition for me getting back into the ring. It was not my intention. I've stated many times that I did it for my son.
I was the kid that wanted to be anonymous in that I'd put a football helmet on and be a member of a team and go out there and maim people. It was a very hard process. It truly was.
Brock [Lesnar] is one hell of a wrestler, and he's a big monster.
I really don't have a favorite team.
You wrestle one night, get up the next morning and fly out to the next city. You try to work out, you try to get some food into you and, lo and behold, you have to go work again. You are living out of a suitcase.
All of my cats are adopted and all show their gratitude on a daily basis. I don't know where I would be without them.
I grew up in the Midwest, so we really didn't have much hockey going on.
It’s so hard for me to sit back here in this studio, looking at a guy out here, hollering my name!—When last year I spent more money, on spilled liquor, in bars from one side of this world to the other, than you made! You’re talking to the Rolex wearing, diamond ring wearing, kiss stealing, whoa! wheelin dealin’, limosuine riding, jet flying son of a gun and I’m having a hard time holding these alligators down!
I'm Ric Flair! The Stylin', profilin', limousine riding, jet flying, kiss-stealing, wheelin' n' dealin' son of a gun!
Whether you like it or not, learn to love it, because its the best thing going. Wooooo!
If you're a man, you don't cry about it, you take life, the ups and downs; if you're a real man you never go down, you just stay up!
Space Mountain may be the oldest ride in the park, but it has the longest line.
To be that man, you've got to beat the man. Woooo!
Diamonds are forever, and so is Ric Flair!
I've had more world championships than you've had women!
I don't think there was one. I can't name one. Not because I had a lot of great feuds, but it would be hard to say the defining feud.
All the women want to be with me, all the men want to be like me.
I'm every woman's dream and every man's nightmare.
I'd love to see Sting come back. The guys that had the potential to make any money and draw any money, they came. The ones that made it, made it, and the ones that didn't, didn't. The list of those who made it, theres lots the list of those who didn't make it are longer then the ones who did.
My God, thank you. Thank you very much. I'm almost embarrassed by the response, but when I see this, I know that the twenty five years that I've spent trying to make you happy every night
of your life was worth every damn minute of it.
If wrestling can be considered an art form, then [Ric Flair] is using oils, and the many others merely water colors.
I'm gonna walk down the aisle in style and profile.
I cant think of any negative [aspects of working in the wrestling industry]. The positive are the money, the comradery, the prestige, the notoriety. A lot of pluses.
This ain't no garden party, brother, thisis wrestling, where only the strongest survive.
When somebody has convinced you that you're not worth anything to anybody anymore, and they spend a lot of time doing it, you start believing it yourself.
Whenever I hear the crowds going WOOOOO!! It makes me feel very good, it means I've worked very hard and earned a lot of respect, each night I go out there I go out there for the fans to make them smile, or make them cry.
My shoes are worth more......than your house!
If you don't like it, learn to love it!
I didnt have any plans to become a wrestler until about a year before I started.
To be the man, you gotta beat the man!
I dont think theres anything positive in the WCW brand at all. It was dead when they brought it. They were going to bury us when they did business.
We used to wrestle every night, 385 times a year. For ten years. 365 days. Never had any holidays off, ever. Holidays were always two-day venues. Two event venues. Afternoon and night.
Which new wrestlers do I think will be the franchise wrestlers? Erm, well Batista and Randy Orton will I think, for sure.
To be a man you've gotta beat the man.
I laugh a lot in the ring when I'm having fun.
The old saying is: 'Time off is a wrestler's worst enemy.'
None of this was written to hurt anybody's feelings.
The guy who could be me, but he knows when to draw the line, is John Cena. John Cena can rock 'n' roll, let me tell you.
There was only a handful of guys who were even qualified to work at the WWE.
I had my first 'Survivor Series' in 1991 and I was fortunate enough to be an instrumental part of the shows I was on.
In my life, I've been a movie star, a rock star, and a sports star, all wrapped up into one-and worked harder at it than anybody else.
Nobody has wrestled everybody in the business like I have, especially not Bret Hart.
I was really good at being a bad guy.
My problem is that I think everybody needs to work as hard as I worked when I was in my prime.
Hell you're Shawn Michaels! The greatest wrestler of all time!
It's the greatest show on earth. It's unbelievable.
I can take more punishment than anyone in the business.
I bleed like nobody else.
My kids are my main hobby but, now theyve gotten older, theyve forced me to do things without them. I do a lot of things with my boat. My wife and I enjoy boating.
We only work the most I ever work is three days a week. Very rare that I will work four. If I'm involved in a scenario where they need me to be in it, I don't mind. They always work around my childrens schedule, their sports, and stuff like that. Thats been very important to me.
I thought Chris Benoit was worthy of being a Horseman. I thought Dean Melinko was. Obviously I thought Steven Michael was, though obviously he was inexperienced, I thought he was a perfect fit as a horseman. I did not like the Paul Roma deal. I did not like Sid Vicious or about two or three guys that they put in there, I just couldnt see it. I couldnt stomach it, but I had to.
I think my fondest memories would be with Sting, and Steamboat, Dusty and er I made a lot of money wrestling Wahoo McDaniel and Jack Mulligan too. Itd be hard to pinpoint one.
I enjoyed my time as Raw Co-Owner. Actually I got beat more! I got beat up a lot as Co-owner but it was ok.
People think its hard to travel to the airports. 9/11 has made our travel difficult, with the security laws and that. As far as comparing what we do to driving 3,000 miles a week, making fifty bucks a night, sometimes one hundred bucks a night, its a lot different. Guaranteed contracts, first class air fare, Hilton hotels in London, Champaign. Waddaya want? What more could you ask for!
To be the World Champion in 1981 was a huge honour.
I was always a fan but me and Kevin Pattero, he was a friend of mine who trained for the Olympic games in 1972 he and I became very close friends and roommates and I kind of rode his coattails into the business.
I like Manchester, Birmingham. I really find this place very nice. Loved Australia. I thought that was awesome.
And Chris Benoit, as magnificent as he looks, is not medically cleared yet.
I've always been a very good heel!
I love the military. They don’t get nearly enough credit for all the hard work they do to protect us, keep us in a safe place so we can enjoy ourselves every day.
Before I was married, before I was with my wife, I was traveling with Ric Flair and women were everywhere. It was crazy. The lifestyle he leads, he's the wheelin', dealin', kiss-stealin' son of a gun. He's Ric Flair and there's no one like him, there won't ever be another like him in the wrestling world again.
Call me sick. Call me deranged. I'm gonna be your worst nightmare. I'm gonna be your hero whether you like it or not!
I'd RKO my own grandmother if it meant keeping this title. Then I'd RKO your grandmother just to see the look on her face.
I understand the psychology of the sport, especially inside the ring.
It's not arrogance, it's just destiny.
That's your first mistake. Do not trust me.
I forgot how it feel like to have the top of my foot hurt so bad from kicking people on the face...
No one will match up to Ric Flair and how he lives.
I entered this ring Randy Orton, Legend Killer. When all was said and done, I left as Randy Orton, Legend.
You want to know why I am the perfect champion? Because you can take the strength of John Cena; the intelligence of Triple H; the desire of Cena; the athleticism of Triple H; the determination of Cena; the ruthlessness of Triple H... and if you combine these attributes into one person, you get Randy Orton. The only difference is that I have one thing that neither Cena nor Triple H has: the WWE Championship.
My accomplishments are endless.
Learning from the best, you will eventually become the best if you have the talent already, if you have that potential.
Ric Flair, you can tell all these people that I'm full of it for calling myself the Legend Killer? Well, I think you're full of it for coming out here every Monday and telling the whole world that Triple H is the best wrestler in the world today. I know it's not true, I'm pretty sure all these people know it's not true and Ric Flair, I know that deep down inside your heart, you know it's not true either which is why it's so tragic to see what you've become. This generation is gonna remember Ric Flair for kissing Triple H's ass!
In this business, it is about making an impact.
If you hadn't noticed, I like to talk about myself.
The key is dictating what the fans do rather than letting them dictate what you do.
Not only am I younger, but I'm better looking.
You think you're funny! You think you're funny Cena, huh? The only pose you're going to be doing tonight is lying on your back with me on top!
The only thing that is pathetic... is you.
I have to put my father over because he really taught me a lot, especially when it comes to out-of-the-ring psychology and how to react when you're approached by fans after a show or in the airport. It might sound silly, but a lot of those things come into play when you're playing a character.
If things go our way, you might see why I'm a legend. And if your daddy has a problem with that, he'll find out why I'm the Legend Killer.
Take a look people, take a good look at greatness!
This one man dynasty has only just begun.
Don't ever interrupt me again. And next time you do, show me the proper respect.
You're nothing but an apple, a silly t-shirt, a catchphrase and a stupid haircut.
Not only am I better looking.. I'm just plain better.
Hey, Vickie, why don't you come down here and reprimand me to my face!
The only true phenom...is me.
From bell to bell, from when my entrance plays and I step through that curtain, people have to wonder what's going on inside that guy's head.
I'm not Triple H, and I certainly am not John Cena.
No one beats The Legend Killer.. Thats why I'm the greatest in this business!
Ric Flair, you put me in this position. You named me the Legend Killer and after Tuesday, you will respect me.
When I walk to the ring, I hear voices telling me what to do and sometimes it's not the right thing, but it's definitely damn entertaining.
I'm going to the main event of Wrestlemania! Where're you going?
The single greatest moment of my life happened in Toronto, Canada!
I'm The Legend Killer, Shawn! Why? 'Cause I kill Legends!
Learning from my mistakes at the same time being criticized by Triple H and Ric Flair made me what I am today.
Greatness has entered the ring! Thank you very much you may bow at will!
I'm sorry Dolph, but around here, you gotta earn respect.
Get a look at greatness!
The only reason you're undefeated at WrestleMania is because you've never faced me at WrestleMania.
I saw her backstage and said hi, took a picture with her. Tried to get a convo going, but the kid had know idea wut to think!
I recently saw Brooke Hogan's new music video, and I've got to say she looked hot.
Roddy how many times have you won a World Championship?
The Youngest World Heavyweight Champion in History!
There's no stopping Randy Orton!
Why can't I be naked baby?!
I pride myself on being a Legend Killer.
I just want everyone to know that even though Hogan won at Summerslam I still pinned him 1, 2, 3.
I'm going to take the legend of Hulk Hogan and kill it!
There's a new sexy boy now!
I'm a third generation superstar.
Someone said DX over here? It was this dipshit with the cowboy hat over here.
So Carlito think about this: all the apple-biting.
You obey Wade Barrett's orders and you disrespect every person who has ever been champion. Including yourself.
